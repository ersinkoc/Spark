# Introduction to Spark Framework

Welcome to Spark! This guide will help you understand what Spark is and why you should use it for your next web application.

## What is Spark?

Spark is a fast, lightweight, and zero-dependency Node.js web framework designed for building modern web applications and APIs. It's built with performance and security in mind, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Why Choose Spark?

### 🚀 **Performance First**
- **4000+ requests per second** on standard hardware
- **Sub-millisecond response times** (p50: 0.8ms)
- **Low memory footprint** (<50MB baseline)
- **Zero dependencies** - no bloated modules

### 🛡️ **Security by Design**
- **Built-in security features** (CORS, CSRF, XSS protection)
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Secure session management**

### 🎯 **Developer Friendly**
- **Simple, intuitive API** similar to Express.js
- **Full TypeScript support** with complete type definitions
- **Comprehensive documentation** and examples
- **Hot reload** support for development

### 📦 **Production Ready**
- **Comprehensive test suite** (100% coverage)
- **Memory leak protection**
- **Graceful shutdown** handling
- **Built-in monitoring** and health checks

## Who Should Use Spark?

### **Beginners**
- Learning web development with Node.js
- Building your first API or web application
- Want a framework that's easy to understand

### **Experienced Developers**
- Need high performance for production applications
- Want security features built-in
